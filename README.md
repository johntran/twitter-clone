## To Run

In project folder in Terminal, run:

> bundle install

> npm install

> rake db:migrate

> rails s -p 4003

Go to "localhost:4003" in your favorite browser. I don't like using port 3000 because most rails projects use 3000.

> webpack -w -d

to make changes and have webpack remake your bundle.js
